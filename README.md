## Project Name: Privacy Post

### Team Members: Arden A. Cole, Lemuel L'Oiseau, and Morgan McErlean

**Project Purpose:**

The plethora of security and privacy based issues facing individuals on the internet, specifically the threats posed by large companies and the presence of data theft, calls for a digital safe space that offers approachable solutions to guard against security threats and increase agency in information security for the individual. Some of the greatest perpetrators of data “theft” are large companies, and individuals largely sign away their rights and give access to these companies without even being aware of the potential consequences and privacy breaches that are occurring. Given the divergent needs for privacy across different platforms, our site will attempt to provide specific advice for preserving privacy depending on the policies and specific threats that each platform poses to the user. For example, preserving privacy when using Google looks much different than preserving privacy when using Facebook or other forms of social media. Thus tailoring advice on platform specific pages will be necessary. Additionally, with regard to nuance on the vastness of the internet and various privacy and identity issues, we hope to provide a forum for users to ask specific questions for their own concerns and for any specific platform, crowdsourcing potential solutions.
